### Abstract
The end goal is to create a cross-platform app that will aid in resource management. The app is primarily focused on perishable items, like food, water, and batteries. Each item will be assigned an expiration date to determine the useful time span. This will allow the user to rotate inventory, and keep items with an optimal lifespan **Before** an emergency. **After** a disaster, the user can determine which item to use first or last, to maximize stock usefulness.
